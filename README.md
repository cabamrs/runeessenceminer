# cabAm's Rune Essence Miner
This is a simple Rune Essence Miner script used with the bot found on [powerbot.org](http://www.powerbot.org/). No configuration is required. Just start the script near the Varrock bank, near Aubury, or in the rune essence mine.

## Todo
1. Only close "INVENTORY FULL" dialog when it is blocking exit portal
2. Override/update interact logic so mouse placement on open-door and mine is correct and doesn't get stuck
3. Antiban
4. Screenshot at end
